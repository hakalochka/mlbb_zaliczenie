            <span class="red">Mages</span> excel in lane clearing and are

            other lanes whenever needed.

            With decent AOE damage for lane clearing,
            <span class="red">Mages</span>
            can take advantage of the shorter lane to farm safely in the early
            game and roam later.

          <h3>Unit Sight</h3>
          <p>
            Each minion grants sight over surrounding 8 units but cannot detect
            enemies in the bush or the Camouflage state.

          <p>

            consist of 4 regular minions and no cannon minions.
            <br />
            <span class="yellow">Surging Morale</span>: Minions gain 10 extra
            Movement Speed per minute.
            <br />
            <span class="yellow">Charging Horn</span>: Once the enemy's
            <span class="yellow">Base Turret</span> is destroyed, stronger
            <span class="yellow">Super Minions</span> will begin to spawn in the

          <p>
            <span class="red">Marksmen</span> rely on equipment and are
            recommended to farm in the Gold Lane.
            <br />
            Despite their weak early game,
            <span class="red">Marksmen</span> can take advantage of the extra
            Gold from the special siege minions to purchase equipment faster and
            provide high sustained damage for their teams in the late game.
            <br />
            Gold Lane is the side lane away from the first Turtle's spawn
            location.

          <p>
            <span class="yellow">Gold Rush</span>: The first 10 waves of siege
            minions grant 35% extra Gold.
            <br />
            <span class="yellow">Rapid March</span>: Side-lane minions have
            higher Movement Speed.

          <h2>EXP Lane</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="red">Fighters</span> rely on level and are recommended
            to take the EXP Lane to level up faster and join the fight over the
            first Turtle. Balanced in both offense and defense,
            <span class="red">Fighters</span> and certain
            <span class="red">Tanks</span> can take advantage of the extra EXP
            from the special siege minions to help their teams gain a lead in
            the early game.
            <br />
            EXP Lane is the side lane closer to the first Turtle's spawn
            location.

            <br />
            Despite their high mobility and single-target burst,
            <span class="red">Assassins</span> are often weak in lanes. So it's
            better they farm in the jungle in the early game and look for
            opportunities to take down enemies that are alone.
            <span class="yellow">Jungling Boots</span> is also recommended, as
            it grants bonus creep rewards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that <span class="yellow">Retribution</span> is required to
            purchase the <span class="yellow">Jungling Boots</span> and enjoy
            the creep reward bonuses, though the rewards from minions will be
            reduced in the early game.

          <p>
            <span class="red">Supports</span> and
            <span class="red">Tanks</span> don't rely on equipment and are

            their allies during the laning phase.
            <br />
            Equipped with either strong engage or buff skills,
            <span class="red">Supports</span> and
            <span class="red">Tanks</span>
            need to look for the right timing to initiate teamfights to lead

          <p>
            <span class="yellow">Roaming Equipment</span> is also recommended,
