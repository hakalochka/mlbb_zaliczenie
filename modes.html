    <div id="main">
      <div id="classic">
        <h1>Classic</h1>
        <p>
          Classic is the first and earliest game mode in Mobile Legends. All
          other game modes use the rules in Classic as a base. This mode gives
          5v5 and the Mobile Legends experience without worrying about losing
          your Rank, but your win rate will be affected, both from the hero side
          and the whole. Classic Mode is suitable for beginners who need to
          familiarize themselves with Mobile Legends games. You can freely
          choose any hero you have, along with the Weekly Free Heroes and any
          trial cards you possess. However, you cannot have more than one of the
          same hero on your team.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="rank">
        <h1>Ranked</h1>
        <p>
          Ranked is a competitive queue for a game that is normally played. The
          rank system is used in matchmaking to ensure that all players played
          equally and fairly. Players earn or lose stars if they win or lose in
          this mode. Warrior, Elite, Master, Grandmaster, Epic, Legend, and
          Mythic (Mythical Honor, Mythical Glory and Mythical Immortal) are the
          seven ranks in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ranked is unlocked once the player's account reaches level 8 and have
          at least 6 or more heroes. Players can invite other players who are
          one rank higher or lower than them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a player reaches Epic V or higher (Grandmaster V or higher in
          Advanced Server), Draft Pick becomes available for future matches.
          Unlike Blind Pick, Draft Pick allows both teams to see their heroes
          while being picked and bans a total of 6 heroes (3 bans for each team)
          for balancing purposes. Heroes who have already been selected or
          banned cannot be picked for the duration of the match.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="brawl">
        <h1>Brawl</h1>
        <p>
          In Brawl Mode you are unable to choose your heroes freely. Instead you
          will be given a choice between two random heroes in your inventory.
          This mode contains only one lane with two turrets defending the base
          in both teams respectively. Brawl matches usually end in a much
          shorter time compared to Classic Mode and Ranked. This type of match
          is best for raising lost credit scores due to reports and AFK
          behavior.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="ai">
        <h1>VS A.I.</h1>
        <p>
          Just as the name of the mode suggests, this game mode will present the
          player with a 5 vs 5 matchup, similar to any other mode. However, you
          will not play along with real time players but instead, compete
          against computer-controlled opponents. An AI (artificial intelligence)
          team automatically driven by the computer will fight against you.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three game modes you can pick in this mode: Classic, Brawl
          and Draft pick.
          <br />
          There are also two difficulty settings: AI: Simple and AI: Normal.
